        <h3>Quality Assurance Manager</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">I love solving people problems and enjoy strategizing on new processes to improve and modernize our QA approach. My goal is for each member of my team to say that I helped expand their skillsets, created a safe environment for failure, listened to them, and made them feel like their efforts truly mattered. I have a knack for hiring and mentoring high performing teams, creating and driving strategies, building consensus based on trust, and helping engineering departments run more efficiently.   </p>

        <h3>Senior Quality Assurance Engineer</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description-investigate"> I have not yet met a feature I couldn't thoroughly test. Whether I am tackling automation, user acceptance, performance, security, or exploratory strategies, I always find the right tool in my toolbox to address the work at hand. I have worked on web, mobile, and desktop applications across all browsers, devices and operating systems. I have queried countless APIs, SQL databases, and log files to search for answers or build mock data sets. Most importantly, I have taken every possible opportunity to learn new skills and welcome new challenges that help me grow and evolve.</p>
